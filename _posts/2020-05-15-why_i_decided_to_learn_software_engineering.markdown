Hi, my name is Brian Craycraft and while I may be new to a structured Software Engineering school I have SOME experience with programming in the past. Nothing professional by any means but I have gone through multiple paid or unpaid online courses and documentation covering both Java and Python languages. Ruby is entirely new to me however and I have to say, so far I am loving it!

I'm not gonna lie and say I was "excited" to be learning ruby, in fact it was the opposite, I was **TERRIFIED** to be learning a **NEW** Language. I remembered how hard it was to just understand the basics of Java when I first jumped online and googled "How To Program" and because I knew nothing about and had never even looked at what Ruby was, I was worried it was going to be extremely foreign to me. **I was wrong. entirely wrong.**

Ever since I was a kid I was always fascinated by the inner workings of pretty much everything Tech. Growing up I'd often find myself asking questions like "How do stoplights work?", "How does the remote change the channel and adjust the volume?" and of course, at the time, "How does my Windows 98' computer just.. work in general?". Out of all the questions I would ask myself the one that piqued my interest the most was, you guessed it, the Computer.

Much like most kids born in the 90's like myself I loved video games and played them quite often when I was a teenager. I believe this was sort of my "gateway" into the world of programming. I once again found myself asking questions like "How does my character do this or that?", "How does it know my character is standing on this or that?" or "How do these NPC's know I am an enemy (to them cause obviously they're the bad guys here lol) or interacting with them?". Almost immediately I jumped online and learned that these video games utilized something called "Programming". 

One thing lead to the next and at age 15 I decided to attempt to learn how to program. At this time I was solely interested in making Video Games, I was a 15 year old boy who played Call of Duty with his friends after school, give me a break! I had no idea the amount of things in our world (especially today) that utilize programming and honestly it wasn't until I turned 19 and moved to Seattle, one of the tech capitols in the US, and was surrounded by tech companies ranging from Video Games to Robotics. It was at this time I decided I wanted to pursue a career in tech and specifically programming. I already build Computers, play Video Games and want a Tesla and to be honest I feel like that is a "Software Engineer" starter kit (brownie points in my book if you know what meme's i'm mocking).

Flash forward nearly six years later where I have found myself in a position I felt school was viable, I found this school called Flatiron. So far my experience has been phenomenal even just barely two weeks in! The curiculum is written and structured so well to the point where I definitely feel challenged and that I am learning but never alone!

If you made it this far I want to say thanks for reading this and that this is my first **EVER** blog so I apologize if its poorly structered or feels all over the place at times. Hopefully with some work I can even master blogging haha!
