How do I do this? Where do I start? How can I do this on my own? Which website should I scrape or pull an API from?

If you're like me these were questions you found yourself asking the day you started your first project. For me, it wasn't so much what the project was asking me to do that I struggled with but the initial step of getting started on something I've never done on my own before. It felt much like being asked to build a restaurant on your own without any prior Architecture experience. I think Architecture is the perfect word and example for this as well because I mean really.. we are building something from the ground up. We start with nothing and end with a (hopefully beautiful) fully designed "building".

I think I spent the first full day (Admittedly I started a bit late) just going over previous material or watching videos (made by the flatiron staff) I had previously seen just searching for the answer of "Where to start". It was the most daunting, stressful and mind-boggling part of this entire experience. I mean really, even if you didn't reach out for help on previous lessons, we still had instructions and tests that guided us along in each and every one of our labs. This was the first time we were truly on our own, yikes! 

I found myself getting overwhelmed with something that otherwise felt so simple. 

Through this experience I learned that getting started isn't necessarily the most important part of programming but just a small step to the end result of your program. In theory I could have started anywhere as long as I remembered to connect all the dots and get all the cogs turning in sync. For example, using previous material in comparison (Artist, Song and Genre), while most of these lessons had you start with either `class Song` or `class Artist`, its entirely possible to have started with `class Genre` as long as you made sure to connect the dots to get your program running like a well oiled machine (or in this case your tests passing).

Once I finally got rolling though, I began to feel more and more confident in my work and suddenly realized "I'm actually learning!". While my work may not be as clean as others I am still a new programmer after all and look forward to learning better practices to ensure my code is fully readable/understandable by anyone who views or works on it!

It is such a relief to finally be finished (I think!) with my project. I feel much more confident in the fact that I truly am learning to program!

Wish me luck in my review!
